# AM186 e86mon utilities for linux/unix #

This is a quick port of those ancient DOS-utilities. It only took a few
changes to compile them.

AMD's licensing allows changes and re-distribution, so i thought, it could
be useful for someone.

It depends on what version of e86mon you are using, what version of these
utilities you have to use. I personally have one board with version 3.22.
I couldn't get hands on a makehex-utility for this version, also i was not
able to update the monitor on this board. 
Maybe someone has makehex V3.22 and can send it to me.

List of files/folders:
- makehex330.c
- makebin330.c
- editmon330.c
- dos_tools\
- hex_files\
